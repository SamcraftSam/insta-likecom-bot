Whatever is good for your soul, do that
Even the stars were jealous of the sparkle in her eyes
Stress less and enjoy the best
Get out there and live a little
I’m not high maintenance, you’re just low effort
I’m not gonna sugar coat the truth, I’m not Willy Wonka
Life is better when you’re laughing
Look for the magic in every moment
Vodka may not be the answer but it’s worth a shot
A sass a day keeps the basics away
